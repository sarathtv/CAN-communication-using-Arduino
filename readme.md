# CAN communication using Arduino 
## In this demonstration we will see how to use arduino to communicate DHT11 sensor data over CAN bus. Also we will see how to capture CAN frames using Logic analyzer.
### The Arduino_CAN_DHT11_Rx folder contains the reciever side code
### The Arduino_CAN_DHT11_Tx folder contains the transmitter side code
